# StyleGuidePage

## Purpose

- Developer-facing visual style guide / component showcase.
- Useful for verifying design tokens, typography, spacing, and component variants.

Implementation: `lib/screens/style_guide_page.dart`

## Entry points (routes/deeplinks/navigation)

- GoRouter route: `/style-guide`

## UI Anatomy (major sections; key components; sheets/dialogs)

`TODO:` Document the exact sections shown by the style guide after reviewing the current widget tree in `StyleGuidePage`.

## States (loading/empty/error/offline) + how each appears

- Primarily static; no backend loading expected.

## Primary actions + validation rules

- Visual inspection only (no confirmed destructive actions).

## Data dependencies (services/repos + Supabase tables if confirmable)

- None confirmed.

## Side effects (notifications/alarms, analytics/telemetry, caching, permissions)

- None confirmed.

## Accessibility notes (only what you can confirm from code)

- `TODO:` Run an accessibility audit pass if this screen is exposed to end users.

## Tests (existing tests that cover it; if none, TODO)

- `TODO:` No direct widget test references found for `StyleGuidePage`.
