# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 03, 2025

## Introduction
Welcome to **MySched** ("we," "our," or "us"). MySched is an application designed for Immaculate Conception Institutions (ICI) to automatically generate class schedules and send reminders by scanning student account cards.

We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at the email provided at the end of this document.

## Information We Collect

We collect information that you provide to us voluntarily and information that is automatically collected when you use the app.

### 1. Personal Information
When you register or log in, we collect:
- **Email Address**: Used for authentication via Supabase.
- **Password**: Encrypted and managed by Supabase Auth.

### 2. Camera and Images
- **Camera Access**: We request access to your device's camera solely to scan the text on your student account card (OCR). This processing happens on-device using Google ML Kit.
- **Photo Library**: We may request access to your photo library if you choose to import an existing image of your schedule/card instead of scanning it live.

### 3. Schedule Data
- The app extracts text from the scanned images to generate your class schedule (Subject, Time, Room, Instructor).
- This schedule data is stored securely in our database (Supabase) linked to your user account so you can access it across devices.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect or receive:
- **To provide the service**: Generating schedules from scans and storing them for your retrieval.
- **To send reminders**: Using local notifications to alert you before your classes start.
- **To manage user accounts**: Handling login and authentication.

## Third-Party Services

We use trusted third-party services to help us operate the app:

- **Supabase**: We use Supabase for authentication and database storage. Your data is stored securely on their servers. You can read their privacy policy [here](https://supabase.com/privacy).
- **Google ML Kit**: We use Google's on-device Machine Learning Kit for text recognition (OCR). No image data is sent to Google's servers for this purpose; processing happens locally on your phone.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- We retain your schedule data and account information as long as your account is active.
- You may request the deletion of your account and all associated data by contacting us.

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware that any data has been collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Effective Date" and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
