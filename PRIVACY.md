- Camera access is used solely to scan student account cards you choose to capture.
- Notifications are used to alert you before classes.
- On older Android versions, read access to photos allows optional import of an existing image of your card.

All personal data is handled according to the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173). Data is transmitted securely to Supabase and is accessible only to the authenticated user and system administrators as required for operation. We do not sell or share personal data with third parties.
